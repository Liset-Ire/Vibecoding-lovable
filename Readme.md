# Full-Stack Developer & AI Engineer Project (Vibecoding with Lovable)

## Description

This project is a full-stack oriented application created using **vibecoding**
principles and developed with **Lovable** as an AI-assisted development platform.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how a developer can combine
**software engineering fundamentals**, **full-stack thinking**, and **AI-assisted
development** to design and build functional, well-structured applications.

Rather than focusing only on code generation, the project emphasizes
decision-making, architecture awareness, and product-oriented thinking.

---

## Project Goals

- Design a complete application flow from user interaction to data handling
- Apply full-stack thinking, even when working primarily on the frontend
- Leverage AI as a development copilot, not a replacement for engineering judgment
- Build a clear, extensible foundation that could scale into a production system

---

## Core Features

- Clear and structured user interface
- Well-defined application logic and flows
- Modular and readable code structure
- Functionality designed with future backend and data integration in mind

---

## Development Approach

This project was developed using a **vibecoding workflow**:

1. Define the problem and desired behavior
2. Translate requirements into precise AI prompts
3. Generate and review code iteratively using Lovable
4. Refine structure, naming, and logic
5. Document decisions and potential improvements

AI was used as a productivity tool, while architectural and design decisions
were made intentionally.

## Full-Stack Perspective

Although the project may focus on frontend implementation, it was designed with
a full-stack mindset, considering:

- Data models and entities
- Possible API endpoints and responsibilities
- Separation of concerns
- Scalability and maintainability

This approach allows the project to be easily extended with:
- backend services
- persistent storage
- authentication
- analytics or AI-driven features

---

## AI Engineering Perspective

From an AI engineering standpoint, this project demonstrates:

- Effective prompt engineering
- Iterative refinement of AI-generated outputs
- Evaluation and validation of generated code
- Responsible use of AI as part of the development lifecycle

---

## What I Learned

- How to guide AI tools with clarity and intention
- How to maintain engineering rigor in AI-assisted development
- How to think in terms of systems, not just features
- How to document and explain technical decisions clearly

---

## Possible Improvements

- Backend integration and database persistence
- Authentication and authorization
- Enhanced AI-driven features
- Performance and scalability optimizations

---

## Notes for Recruiters

This project is intended to demonstrate **how I think and work as a developer**:
- how I approach problems
- how I design solutions
- how I integrate AI into my workflow
- how I communicate technical decisions

It represents a solid foundation rather than a finished product.

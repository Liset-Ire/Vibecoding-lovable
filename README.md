# Vibecoding Projects with Lovable

This repository contains software projects created using **vibecoding principles**
and developed with **Lovable** as an AI-assisted development platform.

The goal of this repository is to showcase how AI tools can be effectively used
to design, structure, and build functional software applications, focusing on
problem-solving, clarity, and real-world use cases.

## What is Vibecoding?

Vibecoding is an AI-assisted approach to software development where the developer
focuses on:
- defining the problem clearly
- designing the solution and application flow
- guiding the AI through precise and intentional prompts
- iterating and refining the generated code

Rather than replacing technical skills, vibecoding highlights **decision-making,
architecture thinking, and product-oriented development**, using AI as a copilot.

## About Lovable

Lovable is used in this repository as the main tool to:
- generate application code through natural language prompts
- rapidly prototype software ideas
- iterate on features and user experience

All projects were intentionally guided and reviewed to ensure they reflect
structured thinking and good development practices.

---

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in its own directory and includes:
- the source code generated and refined using Lovable
- a dedicated README explaining:
  - the project objective
  - core features
  - development approach
  - lessons learned
  - potential future improvements

Example structure:
lovable-projects/
│
├── project-01/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── source-code/
│
├── project-02/
│ ├── README.md
│ └── source-code/
│
└── project-03/
├── README.md
└── source-code/

## What These Projects Demonstrate

- Ability to translate requirements into effective AI prompts
- Understanding of software structure and user flows
- Iterative development and refinement using AI tools
- Clear documentation and communication of technical decisions
- Product thinking beyond just code generation

## Notes for Recruiters and Reviewers

These projects are intended to demonstrate **how I approach software development**:
- how I think about problems
- how I design solutions
- how I leverage AI responsibly
- how I explain and document my work

They are not production-ready systems, but well-structured foundations that could
be extended into larger applications.

---

## Future Improvements

- Backend integration and data persistence
- Improved scalability and architecture
- Additional features based on user needs
- Exploration of data analysis and optimization opportunities
